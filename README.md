# Student-Grid-System-RestAPI-Project
The student-grid-system-RestAPI-project is a Java-based project developed using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE and Spring Boot framework. The project aims to provide a RESTful API for managing students in a student grid system.

Here are some key components and technologies used in the project:

Java Language: The project is written in Java, a widely used programming language for building enterprise-level applications.

Spring Boot: It is a framework that simplifies the development of Java applications by providing out-of-the-box configuration and a convention-over-configuration approach. Spring Boot helps in setting up the project quickly and easily, reducing boilerplate code.

IntelliJ IDEA: It is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides a rich set of tools and features for Java development. IntelliJ IDEA offers a comfortable coding experience and enhances productivity.

MySQL Database: The project utilizes MySQL as the relational database management system. MySQL is widely used for storing structured data and provides robust data management capabilities.

Postman: Postman is a popular API development and testing tool. It allows you to send HTTP requests to the RESTful API endpoints and examine the responses. Postman is useful for testing the functionality and verifying the API's behavior.

The project follows REST architectural principles and implements various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing students. It provides endpoints for retrieving all students, filtering students based on criteria like mark, id, and name, and creating new students.

By using Spring Boot, you benefit from features like dependency management, auto-configuration, and embedded server support. The application is deployed on a local server, and you can interact with it through HTTP requests.

Overall, the student-grid-system-RestAPI-project aims to provide a flexible and scalable solution for managing student data through a RESTful API, facilitating efficient student grid system management.
